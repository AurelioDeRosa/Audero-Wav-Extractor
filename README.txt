DESCRIPTION
---------------------------

"Audero Wav Extractor" is a PHP library that allows to extract a chunk from a
wav file. The extracted chunk of the wav file can be saved on the hard disk,
can be forced to be prompted as download by the user's browser, returned
as a string for a later processing or a combination of the first and second
possibilities. It is very easy to use "Audero Wav Extractor" to extract a piece
of audio from a wav file. All you have to do is give the name of the file,
the start and the end time to extract (optionally you can provide a name
for the extracted chunk).
